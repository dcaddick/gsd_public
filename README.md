!!! Tip
    Use the search bar - it's surprisingly good - :smile:

## **Current state**
I have been focusing on the Microsoft Defender Security suite of tools & growing the Security business for MS Partners based on the Microsoft Security platform for the last 5+ years or so.

Over the years I have reviewed quite a few tenancies and a (not so) surprising trend has been that over 80+% have only ever turned on the first 10 - 15% of the config - so this leaves a **BIG** gap between what organizations think is protected and the reality.

This something that really needs to change - that's what this site is about.
Remove friction and empower customers and partners to cracking on getting things done. 

## **Inspiration**
Inspired by Mark Simos’s [Mark’s List](https://aka.ms/markslist) and a discussion after an “In to the Breach” training exercise over a few beers it was discussed that there should be a local version focused more around “Getting Security Done” (hence the short link to GSD) with a specific focus on the M365 Security platform, but not restricted to just that as we'd like to adopt a very customer centric view point on this. (of course here in Australia we might typically refer to this as Get Shit Done - hence the GSD acronym)

[Into the Breach & Shadow Hunter](<https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/events/microsoft-immersion-workshops/#security>)
Great training experience to get a taste of what a fully configured Defender 365 or Defender for Cloud Security stack is capable off from a SecOps perspective

## **General format & ways of working**
For least friction and best outcome for the effort, start with enabling telemetry and visibility, and work your way from there in each Solution - so with that being said the intention (and eventual aim) is for each page to have the following sections. 

Please work thru these from top to bottom:

-   Enable Telemetry
-   Validate via Alerts
-   Enable Reporting
-   Step up Security Controls
-   Troubleshooting  

As you might have guessed by now, this is no small undertaking, so please bear with us while this gets built out. In the meantime we will continue to share any handy tips and tricks to reduce friction for those of you at the Deployment "coal face"

## **Work in Progress**
So with that, planning got under way to create [aka.ms/GSD](https://aka.ms/GSD), and of course we could always refer to this as Global Security Deployment? Please be aware this should always be considered a "work in progress" and will be updated as we go.

Please note this will be a mix of both Microsoft & non-Microsoft content, if it is of value and can help you with said mission of GSD for Security in the Microsoft Platform, then we'd like to include it - having said that, please feel free to provide feedback on the good, the bad and the ugly as we'd like to improve this over time.

## **How was this site created**
From MkDocs & Material:

-   [MkDocs](<https://www.mkdocs.org/>)
-   [Github Actions Marketplace = MkDocs](<https://github.com/marketplace?category=&query=mkdocs+sort%3Apopularity-desc&type=actions&verification=>)
-   [mkdocs-simple-plugin](<https://www.althack.dev/mkdocs-simple-plugin/v2.1.3/mkdocs_simple_plugin/plugin/>)
-   [Material theme](<https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/>)

Key takeway - no need to touch Docker, Linux or Python, just let a plugin do the heavy lifting for you

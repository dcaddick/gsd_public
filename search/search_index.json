discussion after an \"In to the Breach\" training exercise over a few beers it was discussed that there should be a local version focused more around \"Getting Security Done\" (hence the short link to GSD) with a specific focus on the M365 Security platform, but not restricted to just that as we'd like to adopt a very customer centric view point on this. (of course here in Australia we might typically refer to this as Get Shit Done)</p> <p>So with that planning got under way to create https://aka.ms/GSD, and of course we could always refer to this as Global Security Deployment?</p> <p>Please note this will be a mix of both Microsoft &amp; non-Microsoft content, if it is of value and can help you with said mission of GSD for Security in the Microsoft Platform, then we'd like to include it - having said that, please feel free to provide feedback on the good, the bad and the ugly as we'd like to improve this over time.</p> <p>While this will start off as a LinkedIn Article - it may well transition to either GitHubPages.io or to a hosted WordPress sometime early next year.</p> <p>Feel free to provide

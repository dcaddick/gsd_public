(of course here in Australia we might typically refer to this as Get Shit Done) So with that planning got under way to create https://aka.ms/GSD , and of course we could always refer to this as Global Security Deployment? Please note this will be a mix of both Microsoft & non-Microsoft content, if it is of value and can help you with said mission of GSD for Security in the Microsoft Platform, then we'd like to include it - having said that, please feel free to provide feedback on the good, the bad and the ugly as we'd like to improve this over time. While this will start off as a LinkedIn Article - it may well transition to either GitHubPages.io or to a hosted WordPress sometime early next year.

(of course here in Australia we might typically refer to this as Get Shit Done) So with that planning got under way to create https://aka.ms/GSD , and of course we could always refer to this as Global Security Deployment?

focus efforts on increasing efficiency and reducing TTR (time to remediate) via Automation & SOAR natively within Microsoft Sentinel will naturally improve C3 (SecOps) efficiency without the need for any additional tools.
